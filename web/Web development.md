Web development is
the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications, involving everything from design and coding to functionality and performance, using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive experiences for users across devices. It's broadly split into front-end (what users see, using HTML, CSS, JS frameworks like React), back-end (server, database logic with Python, Node.js, etc.), and full-stack (both).

    Performance Optimization: Making sites fast and efficient.

The Development Process:

    Discovery & Planning: Defining goals and requirements.
    Design & Prototyping: Creating visual mockups (often using tools like Figma).
    Development: Writing the code (front-end & back-end).
    Testing & Launch: Quality assurance and deployment.
    Maintenance & Updates: Ongoing improvements
