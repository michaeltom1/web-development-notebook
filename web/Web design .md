Web design is the process of creating a website's visual layout, user experience (UX), and overall functionality, blending aesthetics (colors, fonts, images) with usability to ensure it looks good and works well on any device, from desktops to mobile phones. It involves planning, structuring content, designing interfaces (UI), and optimizing for performance and search engines (SEO) to create an engaging and effective online presence.
Key Aspects of Web Design:

    User Interface (UI) Design: Focuses on the visual elements like color schemes, typography, buttons, and layout.
    User Experience (UX) Design: Ensures the site is intuitive, accessible, and easy to navigate.
    Visual Design: Creates the overall look, feel, and brand identity.
    Content Strategy: Arranging text, images, and multimedia effectively.
    Responsiveness: Designing for different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile).
